# Frogger
Bare-bones implementation of the 80s arcade game Frogger in PyGame for AP CSA final project. Further updates coming soon.

Current implementation has a starting grass patch, a middle grass patch, roads with car enemies, and water with logs (no turtles yet). The number of car lanes, water lanes, lives, enemies per row, etc. are all customizable; just play around with the files. Image folder coming soon.

TODO:
- Combine the enemy and log files into one
- Add sinking turtles
- Make the collision functions more accurate
